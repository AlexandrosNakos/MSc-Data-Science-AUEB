4.50,2022-12-01,"i’m definitely in the minority when it comes to arctic monkeys - i regard tranquility base as their best record, bar none. the debut is great and i don’t think they necessarily have a bad record in their catalogue, but imo their best material has come w/ them shifting away from their mainstream-friendly pop garage past, and into this analogue, textural space lounge vibe. the car, despite it’s simple, earthly title, is even more zero-g than their last album. i catch a strong david bowie influence on the spacey, spotlit chamber pop tunes on this record, both in terms of the sonics and the vividly introspective lyricism from alex. as someone who’s been getting more into bowie lately, it never came off as a direct rip of his style - more like a loving homage from one astronaut to another. i can’t stress enough the textural quality of the car - everything on here just invokes this slightly dusty space-age lounge imagery, like a ballroom straight out of 2001: a space odyssey. it’s soothing, but simultaneously chilling. i feel like alex, and the band as a whole tbh, are coming from a rly unique place w/ this weary performer thing - given the huge commercial and critical success in their past, i’m sure they have much to talk abt in terms of the hollowness of fame. what a great push forward for this band. interstellarly stellar"
2.50,2022-11-30,who gives a shit
5.00,2022-11-30,"Spies and sly trickery are at the heart of Arctic Monkeys’ latest album, The Car, a deeply moved and heavy-set filter for the late 1960s and early 1970s of rock and pop music. An atmosphere and scope to this extent featured on their previous album, Tranquillity Base Hotel and Casino, and there are remnants of that fallout on The Car. An American-influenced album, or rather, an influence of themes that are drawn on from those that broke it big in the United States. Elton John and David Bowie spring to mind in small pockets for those new singles, but it is broadly found in the B-Side excellence throughout The Car.

Fundamentally, though, Arctic Monkeys have changed little between this and Tranquillity Base Hotel and Casino. For those that hated the latter and loved the former, there must be a degree of self-reflection. Whether it is on the Bennie and the Jets piano keys struck like a defibrilator, a shock to the system, on There’d Better Be a Mirrorball or the wailing 1970s pastiche so closely settling in on The Car’s second single, Body Paint, there has to be some reflection on the style Arctic Monkeys now hold. That wah guitar on I Ain’t Quite Where I Think I Am and its stylistic choice, similar to that of Jimi Hendrix, cannot be ignored. This is the perfect blend for those that found Tranquillity Base Hotel and Casino too artsy and Humbug too heavy.

That wah guitar features on Jet Skis On The Moat too, another major overhaul of stylistic change for the band whose work has effectively moved on from the thrashy guitar of Fluorescent Adolescent. Baroque pop strikes through once more. Introspective moments that have lyrical hang-ups as broad as they are interspersed with spy-like themes. Smoky rooms, keypads and a real, stylistic charge comes through. They are solid tracks, but like Body Paint, will take some time to settle in. Those acoustic strokes on the title track are not just emotionally raw but confirm a permanent change in tone for Arctic Monkeys, that same, polarizing effect of Tranquillity Base Hotel and Casino. It is as broad and inconclusive and intense as that piece. Sculptures of Anything Goes offering a moody, slow approach to the battles of history in Turner’s lyrics should be one of many A-Side signs to that. Those that don’t like, as Turner calls it, the “horrible new sound” had best turn the other cheek.

Orchestral beauties feature frequently on The Car, a piece that is as knowingly lonely as it is experimental. Big Ideas crashes through with notes that lament those same, titular plans and the excitement of new forms. Whether those new forms connect and infect Arctic Monkeys fans is beyond Turner, who criticises the “business of show” on Hello You with such an intensity that it becomes personal. Arctic Monkeys have never truly lost the colloquial edge found on their first record, Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not. They are still intensely aware of their surroundings and use them as a tool for lyrical and instrumental inspiration, but their area of influence has changed and they have grown. So too has their music. Artistic acceleration is found on The Car, an album that is a head above the rest but arguably not as good as all those classic singles fans still want Turner and company to chase down. If they did that, they’d have grown as little as Courteeners have."
3.00,2022-11-24,"The Arctic Monkeys return after four years of practically silence (besides one single and a live album) with their seventh studio album The Car. The Car in short feels like a much more refined Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino. It has all the characteristics that were shown in that album, all the quirks and qualities but the blandness and nothingness has been trimmed down to make this a much more enjoyable experience to listen to.
I’m sure a lot of people were hoping that Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino was a one off and that the band would go back to making music similar to their early stuff but it seems the band are very eager to keep exploring this baroque sound and I’m all for it. The lead single There’d Better Be a Mirrorball gave us an amazing look at what this album would sound like. It really sounded like the band had figured out what they wanted to do. We then got the second single Body Paint which only further cemented that for me. I was officially excited for this album so when it did finally release (and I know I am very late to the party but isn’t that normal by now) I anticipated something great.

The first half of the album is what I anticipated. Tracks one to five are all really good and have some amazing ideas that are explored that make these songs feel interesting and investing. Tracks like the lead single There’d Better Be a Mirrorball and Sculptures of Anything Goes showcases a real change in sound and an experimentation I haven’t really heard in an Arctic Monkeys record. There’d Better Be a Mirrorball is a stellar baroque pop track and really feels like proper ballroom music. Everything about the track feels refined and acutely produced and works excellently as an opener and tone setter. The following track I Ain’t Quite Where I Think I Am has an amazing funk to it and I absolutely adore the choir-like “ahhh”s in-between verses. Then the aforementioned Sculptures of Anything Goes is an incredibly bassy and slightly unnerving track but once again does an amazing job at keeping your attention and making a song in the style of their previous record interesting and captivating. All of the songs on the first half of the album have something great to say about them as they all have something that sticks out.
It's unfortunate that the second doesn’t follow suite.

Tracks six to ten unfortunately don’t follow the trend of the previous tracks and end up feeling somewhat boring and uninspired, much like their previous album. That’s not to say there isn’t anything good in these songs but they feel like such a downgrade from what we’ve already heard. It all just feels a bit boring. Songs like The Car and Mr Schwartz sound way too similar to each other and tracks like Big Ideas just feel like they don’t really go anywhere; it just sort of meanders along until it finishes.
Then we have the closer Perfect Sense which feels underwhelming and while not unfitting it could have been so much more. I can’t help but feel a lot more could have been done with this song especially in the vocal department especially considering the vocals on the opening track and I Ain’t Quite Where I Think I Am.
With such a strong first half it’s really unfortunate to see it squander in the second. I can see myself returning to the first five songs plenty as I really enjoyed all of them but the other five? I don’t really care for.
The Arctic Monkeys have something really good here underneath more bland baroque pop and I am intrigued to see where they’ll go from this. Hopefully their next release will be the album that shows me that they can make a true ballroom album that doesn’t kill itself midway through."
3.00,2022-11-19,"Transitioning from the gorgeous piano balladry of 'Tranquillity Base Hotel And Casino', the car continues the sound but strips it of vision and consistency. The instrumentation throughout the album which remains gorgeous throughout its best moments, from the twinkling pianos of 'There Better Be A Mirrorball' to the shimmering and unhalted guitars which ring out throughout body paint and add a jazz-like flavour to tracks such as 'Jet Skis On The Moat'. Furthermore, efforts such as 'Body Paint show that Alex can still write a good hook and offer vocals that benefit a heavier rock mix. However, I cannot say this for the rest of the album. The instrumentation seems to be hit or miss, with 'sculptures of anything goes' one directional sound lacking any memorability. For the most part this isn't really an issue as outside of moments like this it stays interesting and well mixed for most of the album's duration. The main issue is Alex's vocals which just don't hold up to the standards needed for lounge music. This becomes incredibly evident in songs such as 'There better be a Mirrorball', 'I ain't quite where i think i am' and 'Body paint' where his vocals sound out of place and uncomfortable by the end of the track - struggling to coexist with the instrumentation in the mix.

Altogether, whilst the car is a somewhat satisfactory successor to Tranquillity Base, it is a mixed bag of tracks that lacks the depth and vision of their previous album."
4.00,2022-11-19,"Thank God for Alex Turner. He's of the same age group as me and he's heading a last gasp rock band who are actually doing creative things with the form and challenging themselves (and their listeners). I've grown out of a lot of millennial indie, even if it was seminal for me when I was growing up. But the Monkeys keep on giving.

I'm one of those (are there many?) that thought Tranquility Base was a masterpiece and their best album. I'm thrilled that they didn't rush back towards rockin and rollin after the generally negative and/or confused reaction to it. The Car is another interesting and provocative album full of intricate arrangements and Turner's unique gifts as a lyricist and storyteller. It's another classic grower not a shower. It's also mature and somehow earthy and real and feels like your mid 30s.

I'm a fan of this band and their catalog of constantly shifting sands."
3.00,2022-11-19,"My only experience with Arctic Monkeys is their debut, a great garage rock album, with this album, the band has left those roots and dabbled further in baroque-chamber pop soundscapes, Alex Turner's voice is mixed so that he sounds like a foot away from you, perhaps singing in a room of some kind, I think that's a little neat, the instrumentals are lush, with some grand string arrangements, all of this should lead to a positive review, but I just find the songs do not differ as much as I wished they would and Alex's voice on here doesn't really leave the comfort zone of ''close-to-listener-introspection'' tone, it is not horrible by any means, but not good either."
4.00,2022-11-17,"Ustedes no tienen idea de la cantidad de veces que escucho Mirrorball al día. En mi top de Arctic Monkeys, The Car probablemente se ubica así:

- Tranquility Base hotel and Casino
- Watever people say I am, That's why I'm not
- THE CAR
- Hambug
- AM
- Favourite worst nightmare
-
-
- Suck it and See"
2.00,2022-11-16,"The Car feels more like an assortment of demos or left overs from TBH&C with no real understanding of what it wants to or is trying to be more than anything else. The production is good and has a consistent sound pallet throughout but that just doesn't save this album for me personally.

There's no dynamics in the track list, nothing that switches it up and gives some variety, even to the point where during my listens certain tracks felt like they were blending together (There'd Better Be a Mirrorball and Body Paint come to mind"")

This album isn't bad by any means and in isolation, I quite enjoy some of these, however when in context of the album, it just falls incredibly flat.

Fav track(s): Body Paint, I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am,

Meh track(s): The Car, There'd Better Be a Mirrorball, Mr Schwartz, Jet Skis On The Moat

Worst Track(s): Sculpture of Anything Goes"
3.00,2022-11-14,"Much of The Car feels like a farewell to the ""old"" Arctic Monkeys. No longer cheeky and boisterous, the band are more sincere, introspective, and mature. They're aware of moving on, and aware of how moving on might ostracize some of their fanbase.

If you can forget that Alex Turner is the vocalist, this really sounds like a brand new band. The vocals are intimate and close, like Turner is in your room singing to you. Matt Helders' restrained drumming is unrecognizable compared with his busy, fill-heavy drumming on Arctic Monkeys' earlier albums. The album is driven by strings and piano rather than rhythm and guitar, but the string arrangements are beautiful rather than sappy, with obvious film-score influences.

Turner is aware that The Car (and Tranquility Base) represents a departure from the sound that defined Arctic Monkeys and made them famous. ""I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am"" sounds like an acknowledgment that the band are in new musical territory where they're not quite sure if they belong. On ""Sculptures Of Anything Goes"", Turner sings about ""blank canvases"", hinting at the band's deliberate experimentation with expanding the scope of their music. On ""Body Paint"", Turner says he'll use his costume (effectively a new persona) as a writing tool, again suggesting a conscious shift towards a new sound. It's easy to hear tracks like ""There'd Better Be A Mirrorball"" and ""Perfect Sense"" as ballads about lost loves, but in the broader context of Arctic Monkeys' new sound, they really sound like ballads about lost youth and lost selves—a band purposefully shedding its skin.

Arctic Monkeys are on the verge of something great with The Car, but they don't quite get there. The music is at times difficult, strange, and wandering, and the vocal melodies in particular can be tough to follow. Nothing here really grabs me, but I think if they can find a way to marry this new sound with some of their old sound, they could produce something amazing.

3.50,2022-11-11,"After the release of Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino, most listeners became divided in the new sonic direction that Arctic Monkeys went in and rightfully so. With the release of their latest record, The Car, Arctic Monkeys are doubling down on their previous efforts but with better execution. At times, it feels like they continue to play into the tropes that lock them into mediocrity.

Production: First and foremost, just like Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino, the record sounds astonishingly well done. These tracks come off as something that was recorded in the mid-'70s onto tape and mixed on an analogue board and that perhaps is the case. The record is so full and lush that you can close your eyes and let your mind wander with how soft and padded the instrumentation are. One track to another, it's consistent in its sonic approach, at most there are changes to the tones of their guitars but other than that it feels like the album was recorded in 1 extensive studio session. You have your usual fuzzy, wah-wah-infused guitars, big and lush bass lines, and soft yet well-textured drums with the Fender Rhodes to fill in space when needed. What is new though is the use of string arrangments on almost every track, they incorporate strings to provide a grander emotional execution to the endings or to further support Alex in his performances. This perhaps is the greatest addition or change to their sound as it reduces the repetitiveness and slog that came with the previous record.

Mixing: Alongside the production, it feels all the recording and mixing were done from tape to an all-analogue board and then digitally transferred to get mastered. The soundscape is texturally padded and not a single thing pops out of the mix unless it is required to relay a message of the music. At most Alex turner is the only thing that changes dynamically besides the strings and it's quite noticeable from the recordings. Everything is well separated, and to fill and pad the space that is where strings and further use of the Fender Rhodes appear to interconnect the instrumentation into this warm haze that can be described as a dim light in the distance covered in fog.

Songwriting: Musically, its smooth, warm and sensual, practically anyone can put on this record and let themselves drift away into the record, but the one thing that is stopping the record from progressing any further than just a great audiophile recording is Alex Turner. Alex is one of those songwriters of which you either enjoy his obscure writing style or are off put by it. For the most part throughout the record, it's the latter. It's simply put, boring, while the tracks are running at a steady pace at around a 3:20 min pace, Alex doesn't seem able to progress any of his ideas to full visions. Most of the time it just feels like random ideas or sentences that at face value seem like great Quotables, but when strung into a full-length track and let alone a full-length tracklisting, it comes off as dull and annoying after a while. The same can be said about his performances on the record but that is what is to be expected at this point coming from the previous record.

Overall: Now while most who will be listening to the new Arctic Monkey's album is of those who are fans or are trying to see if they have recaptured their hit-making capabilities off of AM or their high and hungry energy off of something like off of Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, this is not the case. They double down on what worked for them beforehand in 2018 but with a few improvements in the musical arrangements. It's worth a listen for those who want a great-sounding recorded, but not for those who can't tolerate Alex Turner in his ability to write."
4.00,2022-11-07,"Highly anticipated and it delivered for me. We knew we weren't going to get the energy of their debut album and this is a conceptual album, something we dont associate the AM with but it's a good change"
5.00,2022-11-05,"Not for rockists. Alex sings sometimes like Curtis Mayfield, there is a late 70s slow funk sound in some songs (I Aint Quite Where I Think I Am"", ""Jet Skis On the Moat"" ...) It is like if one of my rare favorite rock groups was moving to my own tastes for soul and lounge, justifying long afterwards my interest in them. There are guitars, be reassured, but also beds of strings while Alex croons, Northern (Soul) style ...

I was certain it would be a good album and longing to listen to it, and finally I like it even more than expected. I don't know how high those Monkeys will climb, but they are already much higher than most pop and rock acts.

P.S. : After three listenings, I find it even better."
,2022-11-04,"“A musician who loves the slow tempo will take the same pieces of sound slower and slower. So there is no standing still in any love.” (FN, 294)

The album begins and with the first bar it is already clear – everything is different. The next 37 minutes will be something “special”, whether good or bad cannot be said yet – basically, in modern times the word special is too often appointed as a synonym of praise – but our intuition shakes us awake. But this should give us pause for thought. After all, our intuition is frequently a way out to avoid actual intellectual debate and instead surrender to the “inner voice” that sometimes borders on the esoteric. In this way, however, intuition typically becomes an easy victim of ideology. What we ourselves call our own “inner voice” is in fact a complex web of ideological delusions that covers its tracks as it passes through us – by influencing our behaviour – recycling itself and ultimately reinventing itself. After all, we live in a time when our smartphones, our search engines, etc. know us better than we know ourselves, so that we begin to dissolve our selves into ourselves. Similar things can also be found in Horkheimer and Adorno, albeit in a different context, but that does not diminish the accuracy of the actual statement:
“While the individual disappears before the apparatus he serves, he is better supplied by it than ever.” (TWA, 4).

A similar motif is found in the second song on the album, entitled “I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am”, which states:
“Freaky keypad by the retina scan.
[…]
I ain't quite where I think I am
[…]
You know the face, but you can't see past”.

At this point it is easy to take the common route of direct interpretation, but I think we need to break away from this approach and use a cultural critical dialectic to analyse what is being said, as anything else would only touch the surface. For example, a simple interpretation could be that the lyrical self has changed, due to external and internal circumstances, but his biology has remained the same (“Retina Scan”). However, I argue for a more radical interpretation. The sentence: “You know the face, but you can't see past”, suggests an alienation of the individual from himself, as Horkheimer and Adorno also diagnosed it in the above quote. But what if the individual himself is looking for something that is not there? Recently we have been hearing again and again about what lies behind the “mask”, the hidden personality, the deepest inner self; or as many C. G. Jung followers would say, the subconscious. But what if that doesn't exist at all? Slavoj Žižek has an ideology-critical answer ready for us:
“We deceive the other with the truth: in a world where everyone is looking for the truth behind the mask, the best way to deceive everyone is to wear the truth itself as a mask.” (SZ1, 77).

So what if Arctic Monkeys have realized this (indeed, it doesn't matter whether they have realized it or not, art is always to be separated from the artist)? What if the “tangible personality” of this album doesn't give a glimpse behind the mask at all, but instead shows the artist/band as they are? Individuals who move through time and, in the style of Baudrillard, slowly lose themselves in the recursive loop of hyperreality and/or unlearn to see themselves as themselves and instead search for their own “mask”, which does after all not exist.

In several places throughout the album, there are small references that could confirm this thesis:
“And how's that insatiable appetite?
For the moment, whеn you look them in the eyеs
And say, “Baby, it's been nice”” (There'd Better Be a Mirrorball)

“Is that vague sense of longin' kinda tryin' to cause a scene?
[…]
Puncturing your bubble of relatability
[…]
The simulation cartridge for City Life '09
[…]
Flash that angle grinder smile, gasp, and roll your eyes” (ibid.)

“They shot it all in CinemaScope
As though, it's the last time you're gonna ride” (Jet Skis on the Moat)

And so on.

Another clue is provided by the monotony of this album, which is often so strongly criticized. The simplest explanation is also the most boring: in the attempt to compose a concise concept album, they have not managed to get a grip on conformity and variety. However, we must not forget the expressionism of bygone days here, which tried to draw attention to the dreariness of the machine-driven world through its grey-on-grey aesthetics. A probably very well-known example is the film “Metropolis”. And indeed: even now we are experiencing an advancing alienation from ourselves and an absorption in the machine. This also shows that the title, “The Car”, is by no means a coincidence. The car has always been man-turned-into-a-machine and is increasingly displacing real people from their habitat (forests criss-crossed by roads, public parks turned into car parks, etc.). This circumstance also manifests itself linguistically: when an engine goes out, we say it has died. The monotony of the work is therefore not a failure in this case, but on the contrary, a success. Like an engine, it pounds in the same beat, repeating and overtaking itself, just as a machine would. Furthermore, this circumstance could also be diagnosed as a critique of the culture industry itself. As Wolfgang M. Schmitt and Ole Nymoen point out in their “Influencers. The Ideology of Advertising Bodies” note:
“'Immergleichheit[roughly sameness]', according to Horkheimer and Adorno, characterizes the culture industry, which itself must be understood as 'the most unbending style'” (WMS, 63).
So a perpetual sameness, as an allusion to the perpetual sameness of the music scene, in which something that has worked once is endlessly replicated, only under a different name. In such a case, the name is secondary anyway, because no individuality is being striven for, it's simply about exploiting the zeitgeist. Slavoj Žižek has an interesting point of view on the culture-industrial exploitation of our time in his work “Trouble in Paradise”:
“[T]he exploited are not only those who produce [in this case the musicians who have to chase a trend in order to survive in the fiercely competitive business] or 'create', but also (and even more) those who are condemned not to create” (SZ2, 23). At this point, Žižek pleads for a dialectical reinterpretation: the concept of exploitation thus contains its own negation. Not only the directly exploited musicians, who have to give up their creativity and thus no longer correspond in any way to the artist portrayed by Thomas Mann in Tonio Kröger, but also those who are prevented from being able to create anything at all. A buzzword that comes to mind at this point is the so-called “gatekeeping”, which is certainly celebrating one of its high points in the music industry. Similar to the world of influencers, there is a belief that everyone can make it, as long as they put in the effort and show performance. This is not the case, neither with influencers nor in the music industry, as Wolfgang M. Schmitt and Ole Nymoen observe:
“Everyone – they are the best proof – can do it. Everyone is different and is allowed, no, should be. But the claimed plurality is merely colourful uniformity. Content that challenges the viewer is almost nowhere to be found.” (WMS, 61)
It is all the more astonishing that an established band like Arctic Monkeys has created just such challenging content. Sure, we're not talking about a creative quantum leap like Radiohead did in the past, for example, but it takes a fair amount of courage to release an almost 5-minute-long track in these days when tracks tend to get shorter, reduced to a minimum, adjusted to TikTok. In my last review, I spoke of Yeah Yeah Yeah's lack of courage, here it is. An album that resists the TikTok aesthetic and the trend of art to indispensably follow said aesthetic.

I conclude with another quote from Horkheimer and Adorno:
“What would be different is made equal. That is the verdict that critically erects the limits of possible experience. The identity of everything with everything is paid for by the fact that nothing may at the same time be identical with itself.” (TWA, 18)

Arctic Monkeys are victims of our modern times: due to the omnipresent monotony of our everyday life, art has to become a spectacle and is no longer allowed to be simply art. It is degraded to a pure entertainment medium, orchestrated by the system to wash away any radical ideas from the mind. Variety – necessary to sustain production – is outsourced; modern music follows algorithms, which in turn follow the human psyche, which in turn simply wants dopamine. At the beginning, I wrote that something was missing. However, it is not the album that is missing something, we are. “The Car” therefore does not deliver what it is supposed to, but thus delivers exactly what it has to: an old, new, ever-same perspective, which, however, only reveals itself to us when we stop just listening and start hearing instead.

2.00,2022-11-04,A strange mix of glacial Scott Walker-esque beauty and really limp attempts at funkiness. The latter vastly out-number the former. There's a dearth of tunes to the point where this is completely unlistenable which isn't redeemed by the moments when the beauty shines through. Largely turgid and a real waste of talent.
4.50,2022-11-03,"This album isn't anything extraordinarily new for the world, but it is a very bold new direction for Arctic Monkeys.

To me it is technically impecable. The production, the handling of the instruments, the vocals and the lyrics are all top notch.

It is definitely inspired by David Bowie, it has tinges of the recent soul-inspired standouts in the current zeitgeist, but I've read other reviews and was left wondering how are these negatives? Why do bands need to stay in the pigeonhole we appoint them to?

Because it's not a half-attempt at paying homage by a semi-talented bunch, it's a real attempt by the extremely talented Arctic Monkeys, and it is good. A thoroughly enjoyable experience. I'd pick it over the 2 Frank Ocean albums, and I'm hopefully not saying this to take a jab at Frank Ocean, but just to illustrate that different people doze off at different things.

Anyway, less about what other people say about this album and more about what it is: it's slower, indeed.

The first half is very strong and decently varied within the constraints of the direction. The second half meanders a bit.

But it is not edgy, it does not attempt to be a cult darling, it doesn't go out of its way to appease - all positives for me, maybe less so for consumate art consumers-, it is an honest appreciation of a particular style of music, and there is plenty to enjoy in there."
3.00,2022-11-02,"One of their weakest albums. I admit that I have not listened to it enough to be able to give a complete judgment like what I can give to the other albums, however I believe that the charming of the others is more on my listening radar. There are some really nice tracks: There'd Better Be A Mirrorball is a great ballad accompanied by sweet strings and a hypnotic drum beat, a great introduction to the concept of the album; Body Paint, although it could be mixed much better, has all the elements needed to make the song an excellent piece of music composed like god commands and various sections that hark back to the Beatles and Bowie. The other tracks on the album are inferior in my opinion but there are some highs like Sculptures of anything goes, the title track and Hello You. The rest for now is quite meh ish for me. I don't like how they introduced the funk sound and Alex's vocals are gradually getting worse (although I enjoyed his performances in TBHC, especially in The Ultracheese). I hope it will grow in me over time but for now it's the penultimate in my pick of arctic monkeys albums, just above Suck it And See."
1.50,2022-10-31,"If you were to take a 1970's David Bowie record and strip away much of its soul, glamour and memorable songwriting, you would most likely end up with something like this. Save for a few good moments such as the opening and closing tracks, much of this record was just insanely boring. Chord progressions are generic, songwriting is uninspired, melodies do nothing for me and the vocals are just straight up awful. This whole Bowie impression feels unfaithful at best and downright insulting at worst. As boring as much of this album tends to be, there were actually a handful of tracks that were just unbearable. Take, ""Jet Skis on the Moat"" and ""Sculptures of Anything Goes"" where the total lack of anything interesting results in painfully meandering tunes that feel twice as long as the runtime suggests.

This album just feels like a soulless homage to old school pop and glam music, removed from its best qualities and way too derivative of the time period to give it a fresh, modern spin. But I will say that there were some moments, rare moments mind you, where some of the melodies and some of the arrangements were actually quite nice like on the tracks, ""There'd Better be a Mirrorball"" and ""Body Paint"". Ironic considering these two tracks were the lead singles for the album. But sadly, tracks of that quality were too far in between to really keep me invested throughout my entire listen. Outside of that, this album was just too boring and rudimentary that I honestly lost interest by the fifth track. But whenever I did at least try and get invested in the compositions, those horrendous fucking vocals kept pulling me out of the entire experience.

Had the vocals been at least serviceable, this album as a whole would've been as such. Sure, sonically, this album is mostly pretty empty and the instrumentation is absolutely nothing to write home about but had this been the case, I would've just shrugged, let out a nonchalant ""eh"" and went on with my day but...nah, the vocals turn a boring but inoffensive record into a terrible one. It's funny because on previous records, Alex Turners vocals weren't anything bad at all but honestly, that's likely because his style is more fitted for garage rock than it is this watered down glam-era Bowie bullshit. To me, this just sounds like a really terrible impersonation of the man, almost like the shit you'd hear in a karoke performance of ""Life on Mars"" with your best friend after he got absolutely hammered.

3.00,2022-10-31,"I did not love this album. It didn’t really resonate with me, and from the looks of it; didn’t resonate with many others. I listened quite a few times and couldn’t get hooked. Despite this; Body Paint is one of their best songs to date. Otherwise; I’m not a fan of the different approach the band took. It does make me curious where the band will go next."
3.50,2022-10-31,"The first 5 songs are amazing, then the title track the car comes and kind of ruins it, but then it’s saved by the rest of the album, although not being as good as the first half, being much better than the title track."

3.50,2022-10-30,"More like Arctic Musings am I right? They should rename themselves Arctic Meanderings, ha ha! Yo, wouldn’t it be funny if they renamed themselves Abstract Monkeys? The Car is what would happen if Alex Turner never saw Bladerunner and instead binged thousands of arthouse pictures from the Golden Era of Hollywood. It’s artsy, it’s a little pretentious and it’s very meandering. Lyrically there is never really a topic of focus, and with the increased orchestration and the oft-gentle vocals, it’s a good fit. Alex has the suave personality to pull it off, and can up the pretentiousness without it becoming overbearing or even particularly noticeable. It does lose the sharpness of their best work, and that’s something that I missed listening to this, but it’s another solid record from the group that takes the band into even more unexplored territory. They explore it well, it just doesn’t quite feel exhilarating."
3.00,2022-10-29,"I am whelmed.

I really wanted to like this album and maybe three tracks in, I thought I really was going to. But then the instrumentals - while still beautifully arranged and produced - kept going on and on in the exact same manner and Alex Turner kept on singing in this very weird, sometimes croon, sometimes spoken word-ish style and the whole thing kind of fell apart for me by the end.

It's not a bad album. Again, instrumentally it sounds nice and there are several moments that I did appreciate. But my god is it monotonous when you listen to it all the way through.

While Tranquility Base still had a loose concept going on with the eponymous fictional recreational space, The Car lacks even that and Arctic Monkeys - for me anyways - is more and more becoming a synonym for elevator music, just kind of running in the background.

I get that this seems to be kind of the point with Arctic Monkeys' new sound and the lounge-y direction, but I have a hard time seeing the appeal of it. It's not bad, it's not really good, it just kind of... is."
3.00,2022-10-29,"The Car is a easy listening album with lots of strings and slow paced songs, relaxing rock you could call it.
It's not bad to listen to for sure, but it makes me nostalgic to put on the old stuff with a bit more punch and more garage rock/alternative style that turned me into a fan to begin with.

Certainly not a bad album, just not my thing."
2.00,2022-10-28,"What a boring, unmemorable album."
2.00,2022-10-28,"well orchestrated album that thinks it is smarter than it actually is and a lot of the songs kind of blend into mush. while this sounds like it would be outright unbearable--there are several saving graces. these include Turner's bizarre Bowie-like delivery, indulgence in this weird type of chamber glam sound, and self-reflective wallowing that I find oddly audacious. a listen I do not regret--but I doubt I will come back.

not my thing--worth a listen"
2.00,2022-10-28,"the car is in many ways forced maturity . i was actually holding out candles for this album bc in many cases the single id been listening to - aka the opener of the album - was quite good !! its unfortunate this is just another outing of mediocrity for the band though as expected . alex turner isnt really that potent a vocalist nd when u direct yr bands direction into a more stripped back sound knowing that yea it just doesnt work out for the band here . some nice david bowie worship but ultimately the sound they started out just pan together much better lol . who asked arctic monkeys for this

its kinda insane to me arctic monkeys fans are still desperately holding on to a possible critical reevaluation of the band when this band never was really as good as ppl say they were in the first place . like yeah if their music has been made by any other annoying indiebro acts or if they had come from the windmill act or smth yeah believe me theyd just be as overrated as yr bcnr yr black midi or yr sufjan stevens but im sorry to break it to u theyr perfectly rated as is . the cope is kinda hilarious honestly"
1.50,2022-10-28,"UK indie rock outfit the Arctic Monkeys go deeper down the lounge pop rabbit hole that they explored on 2018's divisive Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino with their newest release The Car.

Spearheaded by lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter Alex Turner, the Arctic Monkeys are no strangers to switching things up album-to-album. Once a blistering indie punk rock band, they have morphed into a Bowie-influenced lounge act that shares more in common with Turner's side project The Last Shadow Puppets than the Monkeys of days past. The Car sees their sound become even slower, more orchestral, and oblique. Turner, ever the talented storyteller, has shifted his vocal melodies, tone, and lyrics to inhabit an abstract space. The result is a hot mess of an album that, while at times genuinely beautiful in sound, is a slog to get through - this despite clocking in at a brisk 37 minutes.

One of the album's highlights is the elaborate instrumentation that serves as the canvas over which Turner paints his wildly broad vocal strokes. Bombastic, 70s-inspired, funky guitar tones are used to excellent effect on I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am. The brass during the bridge of lead single There'd Better Be a Mirrorball packs the perfect punch to elevate the song to a transcendent level. The outro of Body Paint builds to a spectacular conclusion with the addition of guitar bends. The ominous synths and pounding bass on Sculptures of Anything Goes provide a tantalizing tease of what could have been, but the track ultimately goes nowhere. Unfortunately, these highlight moments are too few and far between, and the listening experience ends up being quite monotonous.

Indeed, that is the primary problem with the album. Most of the tracks blend into each other as Turner uses grating falsetto vocals to wander his way through the album. This man must have developed a serious disdain for vocal melodies because I can count the number of hummable phrases on one hand. It's almost as if he has intentionally strayed from the beaten path, singing slightly off rhythm or throwing in a falsetto to avoid the alarming possibility of someone singing along to his music. The result is that there simply aren't many memorable moments on this album. While Turner pushed the boundaries of his lyricism with the concept of a space hotel serving as the background against which he explored concepts ranging from politics to technology to science fiction, the lyrics on The Car are obtuse. Gone are the bombastic, self-aware nods to a character that Turner inhabited on the previous album. Gone are the witty, observational lyrics of his earlier material. Ultimately, the lyrics, like the vocals, are simply too labyrinthine to be memorable.

While Tranquility Base felt like an Alex Turner solo album featuring the Arctic Monkeys, The Car feels like a Last Shadow Puppets album featuring the Arctic Monkeys. There's more orchestration, more abstract vocals, and lyrics that are difficult to follow at best - all trademarks of Turner's side project. I can see the appeal for fans that enjoy The Last Shadow Puppets and that particular style. However, I cannot see this album appealing to the fans that have been with the band since day one, and it does not strike the perfect balance between artistry and commercial appeal like Bowie did in the 1970s and 1980s. It pains me to say it, but Alex Turner is the weakest link of this project. His ambition exceeded his grasp, and the result is a muddled mess of an album that feels overlong despite it's relatively short runtime."
2.00,2022-10-27,"I could say I'm underwhelmed, but the trajectory of Arctic Monkeys has been clear for a while now. The Car shows the band moving deeper into unfamiliar territory to the point where this band is virtually unrecognizable when compared to their early material. I would like to praise Arctic Monkeys for doing something different and... unique? There's the problem, it's different for them, but it's not very unique. In fact, much of the aura around this album feels very cliché and artificial. While the production holds some strong moments sonically, it generally just sounds too familiar, very reminiscent of late 60s-early 70s baroque pop. Alex Turner himself surprisingly proves to be the album's downfall, where he experiments with the same faux exquisite songwriting that appeared on Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino. This time around, Alex attempts to be more ambitious with his vocal performances to the point that he frequently strays too far out of his range. The only song on the album that doesn't have this problem is, in my opinion, the album's centerpiece ""Big Ideas"", where Alex's songwriting is incredibly compelling and thoughtful, not polluted by the annoying vagueness of his new go-to lyrical style. Overall, a fairly consistent (at least compared to TBHC) but weak addition to the Arctic Monkeys discography.

Favorite Tracks: Big Ideas, The Car, There'd Better Be a Mirrorball"
1.50,2022-10-27,"I think Mr. Mellon man himself has reviewed this album quite well. The instrumental backdrops are exciting and expansive, building in the sonic landscape of the band's last outing but allowing the chamber instrumentation to breathe and expand with the rock instrumentals. However, the singing on here falls so far flat that it’s hard to take the album seriously. The David Bowie influence is extremely potent, but where David’s delivery worked over his moody art pop, for whatever reason Alex Turner’s vocals feel forced or crooning for way too much of the project. The opening track is really the only palatable song and the rest is pretty unforgettable and/or skippable."
2.50,2022-10-27,"It feels like an experiment to write something they still don't have the knowledge to make, like if after years they decided to try orchestral sounds without using their full potential, like pizzicato or, simply just creating more complex and different lines (the bow instruments most of the time play rhythmic chords). Orchestral sounds have the potential to ""hug"" the listener while giving the sound an open tone but here they are almost never used that way.

The vocal lines are just too similar too each other and they are no where near the power and charisma that they have in the previous album. There are lots of hidden gems both in the vocals and instrumentals, like the funk style guitar and the jazz organ here and there, but they lose themselves in a sea of nothingness, although, to be fair, they give that '70s vibe that I think they were going for.

Onestly I would have preferred a shorter version of this album without the most anonymous tracks, such as the fourth and the seventh, so that the product could have had more focus on the other tracks.
I'd compare this album to sex as seen from the eyes of a woman: although it was good, there was no climax.
They should have probably took some inspiration from ""AM"" or even better from they're older albums rather than reproposing a watered down version ""Tranquility base hotel casino"", mostly to give a more distinct identity and less monotony to this product, because frankly it has half the charm and variety of the previous.
If this album was a cheese it would be Swiss."
3.00,2022-10-27,"How can I say that, I had mixed feelings first listening to this record, but I can define this album as 2 things : ""mid"" and ""tryhard""(as it tries to be something that it's just not)

When I first played it, the intro with There’d Better Be a Mirrorball and I Ain’t Quite Where I Think I Am gave me such high hopes for this one. Was it going to be another classic such as Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino?

And it's not, Sculptures of Anything Goes it's a weird song, a true 50/50, some will hate some will love, and I am one of the haters. Almost slept at Jet Skis on the Moat and Body Paint, those 2 boring sad ballads gave me a feel that they're just trying to make ""505 : chapter 2"" for sad teenagers, ugh.

My two favorite tracks are I Ain’t Quite Where I Think I Am and my absolute favorite one Hello You, I feel that if the whole album was groovy and happy like these 2 songs it would sound hella better.

I felt that this album didn't have a personality, Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino have a whole story about the Hotel in the moon, the coolest lyrics ever and this whole ""Muzak"" feeling you know? That it's playing on an elevator, but The Car is just a lost, mid album.

Should you listen to The Car?
No, I woundn't recommend that one, It's just weird to listen, if you are a Baroque Pop fan in the otherhand, I would recommend you to give it a try.

At my other review, I said about the geniality and how enjoyable Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino is, unfortunately The Car will live forever in it's older brother's shadow."
1.50,2022-10-27,"Interesting. Going even more subdued and stripped-back than their last album is a bold move artistically but it really highlights just how weak Alex Turner is as a lead vocalist. I think he fits the whole of a band's lead singer fantastically, mainly due to his energy and charisma, not his voice.

Arctic Monkeys have only been good for making fun music, not artistic masterpieces. This and their last album are just too ambitious and they simply don't have the skills to make this work. Just make something fun! I will say, ""Sculptures of Anything Goes"" is a really fucking good song, so it's weird that the rest of the album is so drab.


(October 29): Weird amendment, but I just want to add that, no, I am not copying Anthony Fantano. I recently saw his review and is oddly similar to this and I'd hate to be viewed as a Melon Clone (full offense to anyone who is, no offense to Anthony, though).

2.00,2022-10-27,"The most boring group of songs Arcitc Monkeys have released since AM. Except even the song structures on this album can't save it like on that album. There's not much to say here other than save 40 minutes of your life by not buying into the AME reviews. This album balances the line of being unbreably pretentious with underwhelming vocals and too grand for it's own song structure. Hopefully when arcitc monkeys get around to making another album with the same production choices they will actually have good song structures behind the instrumentation. Disappointing and by far the most forgettabl album in their discography (yes they beat AM in dullness). There's a semblence of good melody here and there but it is far and few between (feels like you have to squint for it). When the song is halfway decent it gets interrupted violently by Turner's half-baked vocal performance. The good stuff is like an oasis in a desert I'm completely indifferent towards. This album will be long forgotten by the end of the year. Next please.

2.00,2022-10-25,"I haven't checked in on the Arctic Monkeys camp for a while. Looking into the tent for the first time in a while, I see Alex Turner and company doing some kind of awkward masked ball. Now, this shouldn't be too surprising, they have worn plenty of masks before in the past. With Favourite Worst Nightmare, they wore the mask of a far more energetic band than they once were and with AM they wore the mask of a very very boring band.

However, the set of masks we see being donned by them this time do not seem to fit as well, despite how expertly crafted and well produced the masks are, they are donned in an awkward manner, it's almost hard to tell if the band are wearing them in sincerity or are just wearing it as a gag and this inconsistency of tone makes the costume hard to stomach.

In more direct terms, it is often difficult to tell if they truly care about this album. It is, of course, well made, the orchestration is full and lush, and the lyrics are almost nauseatingly unironic. But despite this, it never feels sincere, the instrumentals feel almost like a bitter pastiche of the aesthetics and Alex Turners' strained and honestly poor quality vocals make the whole experience feel incredibly bitter yet otherwise emotionless. Nowhere else is this clearer than in the production of the album, which, while technically sound, feels inhuman and plastic, it almost reminded me of U2's Songs of Innocence, an album that has such an overly polished production that it completely tramples the emotions of the album itself.

Right at the end here I want to return to a point I previously only skimmed over. Alex Turner marks a lot of the overall issues with the album. His vocals do not sell anything, they honestly sound very low energy and strained and it feels like he is out of his depth for almost the whole duration of the album.

In short, in trying to create their own polished, love letter to sounds of the past, Arctic Monkeys have seemingly crafted something that feels more like a hateful parody. It is sad, but if they continue on in this lane, I don't see them creating anything of their original quality again."

3.50,2022-10-25,"Whilst many have written off the Arctic Monkey's new musical ventures as bland and unworthy of a listen, thanks to their previous and quite disastrous album, Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino[2018], it would be quite a callous move to follow the same suit with The Car[2022], for this is the stuff of legend.

The Car is a dramatic, rambling and poetic monologue from the mind of Alex Turner, whose lovable pretentiousness has allowed us to clearly distinguish that he was the brains behind this operation. It is a return to a niche pocket of music history, reminiscent of a crooning band from the seventies performing in a decaying New York speakeasy to the wallowing old bloke at the bar staring into his drink whilst other customers idle by. It's a classy piece of work.

I am utterly bewildered by There'd Better Be a Mirrorball, an opening track that stuns the listener repetitively with its cinematic introduction of short blasts of a drum kit. Turner croons delightfully through its melancholy melody, the rhythm slow and unchanging and you are left to listen to the remaining tracks with the thought that these primates from colder regions are just begging for their music to be inducted into Hollywood.

Turner has a story to tell, to which The Car has an important role. Perhaps this idea of something so common and yet something that can take you half way around the globe, if you have the funds in such a day and age, is similar to the desire for freedom; freedom in choice of music? With such a divisive reaction to the Arctic Monkey's psychedelic and baroque new style it makes sense for Turner to preach in this way.

I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am certainly portrays the new style in an appealing light. You can't beat it's suave bass line and the vocals match in an artistic sync, rippling this swish undertone into Sculptures of Anything Goes, the climax to The Car's exposition. Body Paint leaves the listener on a high as side one draws its close. The strings materialise the emotion felt within the album, and cement the Arctic Monkeys into the artsy psychedelic rock for good.

Side two provides certain highs, Hello You softens AM's[2013] grunge glory to a jazz ballad that can only be described in its element as supernatural. And then it ends in Perfect Sense.

I am not suggesting in any way that this is the band's best album, in fact I found it slow and dragging in some areas that really needed to Snap Out of It and just return to the Monkey's indie rock that rocketed them to fame. You can tell it was Turner who wanted this album and without his passion for it, that is so obvious here, The Car's emotional composition wouldn't be so glorious."
2.50,2022-10-25,"A part of me genuinely appreciate this change Alex & his band have made to move the band's sound forward. I don't doubt that if I go back into their catalog, I will suddenly become engaged by their indie rock style, but I always try to give everyone a chance, even if the band makes the type of music that I would typically despise. This despising, anger filled aspect is churned into the typical artist moment when a band or artist feels like they have done enough for the genre they are most well known for, and they decide to experiment. Some bands do this to great success, but most fail. Sadly, this failures aren't really monumental pieces of trash that become enjoyable to listen to, but basically audible sludge that feels like an eternity to go through. Arctic Monkeys have essentially achieved this sludge level of quality with their newest record, a surprising mind fuck that is mostly due to Alex Turner's awful vocals and the ranging quality of the instrumentation.

Alex's vocals are obviously the focus of a lot of people's criticism of the record, because the instrumentation here is obviously very beautiful and lush, from the intro to the outro, the orchestral integrations and funk aspects are definitely some nice additions, but they are barely used in an interesting manner. I never felt genuinely shocked by the new path that the Monkey's decided to go on, and it showed with the very first track, There'd Better Be A Mirrorball. Within my very first listen, I believed that this song was a great jam that really pushed the skills of the band, but when I really thought about it, there was a feeling in my gut that was telling me I was wrong. My head actually hurt when I was attempting to figure out whether I loved or hated the song, and that's because I was forcing myself to like the music because of the change Arctic Monkeys were throwing onto their typical sound.

Despite the brand new soulful and orchestral implementations within this record, the typical problems of an Arctic Monkeys record did not go away. The people who adore the record are either insane fans who already love this band or people who are just surprised by the change up and rank this higher than it deserves to be. However, once the shock of Arctic Monkeys trying something different wears off, the truth comes out and it slowly revealed itself upon my full album listen.

I can barely talk about this any longer without popping my brain into oblivion, but this record does not deserve the hype and it never did in the first place. The band still sounds generic like they usually do, their creativity is still about as boundary pushing as an Imagine Dragons record, and Alex Turner's vocals are as terrible as ever. Did I enjoy some of the songs? Yeah, I guess. Would I come back to this record ever? Hell no. There are an infinite amount of artists that deserve more attention than this generic mushy gushy LP, and I just want to move on from this point. Don't give this record a chance, it isn't worth it. Go listen to something else."
1.00,2022-10-25,"Goddamn, this thing is bland. Slow, uneventful, not doing enough in this direction of orchestral fullness."

it's a very classy, velvety sound. it's not as corny as TBHC was at times, I believe that this is an meticulously built album, to a fault maybe. it's not perfect and in general not innovative to the music industry, they're not reinventing the wheel here if you're an arctic monkeys fan, you're well served. above all, I respect the band so much for sticking with what they wanted to do, with what they agreed to do... we fans have our expectations but I believe that our expectations should never interfere with the style of a band.

I'm simply very happy to have these moody tunes to listen while driving back from work, it's very pleasant.

3.00,2022-10-24,"I loved their last album, Tranquility Base, or at least I did for the first few listens. It didn't take long for it to get old. The single Four Out Of Five is the best track, Star Treatment is a solid opener, and honestly the first half of the record in general is solid, but side B really, REALLY drags. I'm a fan of Alex Turner's vocals, but it seems like starting with Tranquility Base he started hamming it up or something. I don't know. Flash forward to The Car and a lot of similar occurrences arise. The first single is the best song, the sound has evolved little only adopting a poppier, down to earth direction this time around as opposed to ""space lounge rock"", and Alex Turner's voice has nearly reached a point of parody. Regardless, I'd say it's a step up from it's predecessor: a much more concise, better paced, and tight record. They've also nailed down that ""lounge sound"". Not sure where the band will go from here. *Sigh* I miss the days of their fast paced dance punk. Adopting a new sound is fine, especially for an aging, experienced band, but two records in and I can't help but feel tired of it already.

4.00,2022-10-24,"the reason tbh+c never clicked with me is that there was a weird blocky modernness to it - the remaining psych-pop and rock elements, combined with the goofy nerdy lyrics, gave it a feel akin to lemon demon or tally hall, youtube-core music for quirked up teens.

the car is INFINITELY more serious and pretentious, and i love it for that. alex turner isn't hiding the uncoolness of the genre behind irony and funk anymore - he's going all-out in earnest jazz-crooning angst, soaring across these soul-crooning ballads. for all of you calling this album middle-aged dad soft rock lullabies, you're goddamn right - and it's not afraid of that anymore. this is destroyer and scott walker and david sylvian, some of the most GOATed artists of all time btw. this is the soundtrack to an artsy foreign language drama film from rotterdam, a random RYM-core sophistipop album from the 70s that inexplicably blows up from a random front page review. this is the music equivalent to filmbro bait, and i adore it."

Decent 7/10"
4.50,2022-10-23,"Following the polarizing reception of Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, Alex Turner had already begun to storm up with ideas for a new album. Numerous sessions followed through over the years though they proved to be fruitless. After the covid lockdowns, an album was starting to take shape in mid 2021 and by late 2022 we got The Car. This album follows in the footsteps of Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino in which it's slower, more mellow, and a bit more accessible. The Car carries some of those Lounge esthetics from Tranquility Base, but this time around the band experiments with sounds of Baroque Pop and Chamber Pop while also sprinkling other genres in as well. While I did enjoy this album on first listen and even more on further listens, The Car is honestly one of Arctic Monkeys weaker releases, but that doesn’t mean its bad.

The opening track and lead single “There’d Better Be A Mirrorball” instantly is very melancholy and incorporates elements of Jazz. The track is plain simply about the end of a relationship. This song is absolutely beautiful and it’s more in a down-to-earth state and is a very simple and soothing track. “I Ain’t Quite Where I Think I Am” is probably one of my favorite tracks on the album as it mixes elements of Funk with some beautiful strings. I love how the strings feel massive and grand on the chorus and the bridge as it just comes out of nowhere. The track “Sculptures of Anything Goes” introduces Electronic elements into Arctic Monkeys’ sound with a moog synthesizer and a drum machine. I like how the track slowly builds on itself before ending things nicely with more orchestral strings.

“Jet Skis on the Moat” gives us a very funky sounding guitar but the track as a whole is slow and sexy. It’s very 70s Smooth Soul and it kind of suits them. “Body Paint” features elements of Progressive Pop and as the bridge really switches things up a bit and it continues to switch things up with an instrumental break. The song then finishes off with a Glam Rock outro reminiscent of the band’s previous release. The title track combines Jazz and Bossa Nova, and this track might be the most beautiful track on the album. The song even features a very trippy and psychedelic guitar solo.

“Big Ideas” seems to have been inspired by Traditional Pop standards from the 50s and the track reflects on the band’s music and their relationship with the music industry. Not to mention the guitar solo at the end is just perfection. “Hello You” brings in a bit more Funk and has a beautiful melody; it might be the most psychedelic track on the album. “Mr Schwartz'' features fingerpicking guitar and is very hypnotic with those reocurring elements of Jazz and Bossa Nova. It is a very intimate song and it makes me all warm inside, I swear I’m not weird. The final track “Perfect Sense” is also the shortest on the album, but it’s also the track on the album that I struggle to get into. Though it is a nice closer, I just wish it was more grand and maybe a tad bit longer.

Overall, The Car is a decent follow-up to the band’s previous release. I like the slower direction the band is heading. It might be considered boring to some because of the slowness which is understandable. I do think it’s one of Arctic Monkeys’ weaker releases, but not the weakest as it does have some very good tracks. I do feel like you have to be in a certain mood to listen to this album, like when you’re winding down late at night or early in the morning. It’s kind of like a Beach House or Fleet Foxes release, you just have to be in a certain mood to listen to it and enjoy it. Still, I’m not disappointed with The Car and I’m glad the band are taking it easy this time around.

Least Favorite Track: Perfect Sense"
2.50,2022-10-23,"The Car expands on 2018's Tranquillity Base Hotel & Casino in much the same way that Favourite Worst Nightmare expanded on their debut. More variety in the music and a wider range of lyrical themes. However, like Favourite Worst Nightmare I think it is weaker than its predecessor.

Many songs seen to follow a sort of pattern, starting slow and sparse, and then halfway through having a sort of build-up, often lacking a proper resolution. Maybe this lack of resolution is what the Monkeys are aiming for, to leave us holding on and expecting more, a theme reflected in the introspective lyrics of tracks like Mirrorball and Big Ideas. However I think Body Paint is proof that the opposite works to great effect.

Sculpture Of Anything Goes is unlike anything the Monkeys have done before, and shows that they are not afraid to get further and further from the dark-fruits-bucket-hat indie rock that a vocal part of their fanbase seems to want, built around a dark sparse synthetic bassline with Alex crooning his best falsetto over the top. The title track is an interesting number too, with acoustic guitar reminiscent of Fireside from their 2013 album AM, it has an almost spaghetti western feel. I Ain't Where I Think I Am is another highlight, with wah wah guitar, and orchestra hits of ""aaaah"" harmonies fused with synthesizers, that start strong and loud, and then quickly fade, reminiscent of Stereolab's Dot's & Loop's (the original lounge pop left turn). The second half of the album is much more forgettable than the first. It just seems to sort of happen, and suddenly it's over.

I don't know how I will feel about this album in the long run. Alex is in top lyrical form as usual, and the music is interesting, but it leaves something to be desired. As someone who adored Tranquillity Base Hotel & Casino, I don't know if I will ever be able to see The Car as anything other than a disappointing follow up. However, it did take me about a year to fall in love with TBHC, so I can only hope that The Car is the same. This is the only the second time in their career that I would say the Monkeys released a follow up, and once again it feels as if they got it right on the predecessor; maybe this time it would've been best left at that."
3.00,2022-10-23,"The long awaited follow up to Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino expands on the Arctic Monkeys continuously developing sound and attempts to draw even more influence, style and dynamic than ever before. The Car is a confidently unique and sophisticated record, Turner and co glide through 10 tracks of rich soul / jazz / pop fusion and though miles away from their northern indie rock roots, still pull together some of the bands most mature work to date on this record. Turner is as poetically cocky as ever, the instrumentals are smooth and classy with rich tones and an eclectic pallet to dive into as well as some beautiful arrangements throughout. It’s a strangely conflicting record that is just as confident and outgoing as it is subtle and delicate and the balance between either end, when done correctly, is where the Arctic Monkeys shine, but it’s holding onto that energy that’s the problem.
Though packed with some impressive singles in the perspective of an album there’s a bit too much style and not enough substance on The Car. The quality of the tracks isn’t particularly the issue more so the material between the highlights just falling flat and struggling to reach any kind of conclusion. The band do commit to the themes of the record and allow their influence to consume the album but there’s too many moments where The Car struggles to deliver on the simpler elements. For every great song on The Car there’s two dull ones and it just isn’t enough to stand on its own as a full length record.
Im anticipating the album will grow on me as time goes on because it’s a decent listen for sure, but far from the Monkeys at their best.

Favourite tracks: There’d Better Be A Mirrorball, Sculptures Of Anything Goes, Body Paint

Least favourite tracks: Mr Schwartz

Rating: 6 / 10"
4.00,2022-10-22,"I noticed that first half(Tracks 1-5) of the record is really impeccable; as a matter of fact, singles were drawn from this part, and definitely has powerful tunes compared to the second part (Tracks 6-10)

I think that this record is ""like"" Tranquillity Base Hotel & Casino, but a bit more experimental, you can actually listen that the band is trying to blend new styles with some features of old albums.

This album, like TBH&C, will probably get better in the long run, play after play. And yes, true fans will always love their stuff, unlike people who complain, because they only expect an AM 2.0.

Best tracks (for me) are: (in order)
1) There’d Better Be a Mirrorball
2) Big Ideas
3) Body Paint
4) Sculptures of Anything Goes

Special mention goes to There’d Better Be a Mirrorball, its tune is so soft and eloquent that fills my pure heart to the brim.
Also Body Paint, sometimes the chorus is stuck in my head, which is always a good sign for a song to have imo.
These were definetely a good choice to pick as singles, unfortunately I didn't find the ""magic"" of these tracks in all the album.

Definetely worst song goes to 'The Car', the title track.
It's a pity that a title track is so weak in terms of melodies, I found it really boring compared to the other ones."
4.00,2022-10-22,"The seventh installment of Arctic Monkeys is a sequel to Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino (2018). Yes, it's been four years out of the blue and you didn't even realize it.

The previous album divided the group's fan base because it was a departure from what they had previously presented, such as AM (2013) or Suck It and See (2011). Tranquility Base was founded on the foundation of ""space sound"" and glam rock. Many of the chords didn't seem to gel and it was beyond intentional.

I liked The Car's predecessor, after listening to it several times with attention, but I could tell that the new formula was not going to satisfy the fans or the new audience.

The Car seems to have taken notes from the above and makes Tranquility Base look like a prototype.

Again the structure is fluid and does not maintain a direct base, based on this feeling of spatiality previously presented. Despite Alex's statement to Big Issue that this installment was much more earthy, it still carries over the essence of space.

The latest LP takes notes from baroque pop and chamber pop and substantially improves the vocals. At times, on the last album, Alex's voice wavered and left a sense of listlessness.

This time there is more delivery, the structure is still blurred, but when he manages to hook in a solo or in some bridge of the songs, he is able to connect.

The points against is that, without falling into something obtuse, maybe it is still difficult to get into the game proposed by the band for the second time.

In fact I've read quite a lot of annoyance about this lack of structure, the monotony of the lyrics throughout the album. Flashes aside, at times it does feel like you're listening to the same song ten times over.

It's another album that divides, but improves quite a bit on aspects of the previous installment. I understand where the complaints are coming from and make perfect sense of the arguments against it.

But I liked it.

I started listening to the first song with skepticism but I got the hang of it quickly. I didn't have to give it a lot of thought like the previous one.

I like the little details that some songs have and moments that, for a few seconds, everything seems to come together in an impeccable way.

They still have a long way to go to perfect the formula, if they want to continue along this line, but if they dedicate enough time to it, they could achieve an album of the year.

My final verdict on ""The Car"" is:

8 out of 10 Cars."
2.50,2022-10-22,"Started strong (Mirrorball), and ended very weak (Perfect Sense). This band has no idea who they are anymore, and songs like Big Ideas show Turner actually touching on this. The amalgamation of highly descriptive lyrics that are describing pretty much nothing interesting nor important sums up most songs on this project. If there is supposed to be melody here it's some of the weakest of their discography, which is saying something. It's a shame because the progression in There'd better be a Mirrorball is actually good."
3.50,2022-10-22,"After Tranquility the AM fanbase was quite split. Some wanted more hooks and some loved the new experimental songs. This one is for the latter. The Car has a glam rock 70s Bowie-style feeling. Unfortunately, the Bowie style doesn't hold up the whole way through. There are too many dull and similar tracks and not enough variety. More hooks next time and energy!

Fav tracks:
There'd Better Be a Mirrorball, Sculptures of Anything Goes, Perfect Sense and Hello You"
1.50,2022-10-22,"after the singles i was kinda curious to listen to this album, with Mirrorball, despite not having a lot of progression throughout, sounded amazing and gorgeous, and Body Paint was pretty good in my opinion, with some heavy glam rock vibes.

well, ummm, turns out this is not... great.
i don't even think it's worth it going track by track, since they all sound the fucking same for the most part. you have some beautiful instrumentals + gorgeous production + alex turner rambling for the entire track. there ya go. that's The Car for you, if that's what you're looking for. there's basically no hooks (or anything really) to keep the tracks interesting and justify their length, which is already short. most of the time, i was only halfway through and i couldn't fucking take it anymore, because just nothing happens.

this is incredibly dull and boring, and kinda pretentious chamber pop. having this coming out the same year as Ants From Up There (go listen to that btw) is kinda ridiculous.
but i notice a pattern here, everytime this band tries to sound ""mature"", they end sounding boring and pretentious instead. happened with Humbug, happened with AM, happened here.

37/100

3.00,2022-10-22,"And if you’re thinking of me, I’m probably thinking of you (track 5)
The Car is a new direction for Arctic Monkeys, a step into a more chamber-pop sound, and it’s a welcome step after their previous effort. The Car however is far from their peak, and does lead me to wonder if they’ve still got the rock brilliance that shot them to the top in the first place, rather than somewhat of a watered-down Bowie. I actually quite like Turner’s vocals on this record, apparently contrary to popular opinion, especially on powerhouse songs like Sculptures of Anything Goes, which was my personal favourite on the album. I would like to mention that “The Car” is a dumb album name. Sure it’s not relevant, but come on. On that note though, the title track leaves much to be desired. It’s almost boring. Which is part of where my issue lies with this album as a whole, this is not Arctic Monkeys at their most diverse, or even half of that. I felt a number of the tracks blending together and Turner’s voice became tiresome after a while.. Not great for an album clocking in at a mere 37 minutes. So have they still got it? Probably not. It’s also worth mentioning how much Jet Skis On The Moat sucked. What were they trying to achieve? Anyway, I think they could make something really cool outside of rock if they stick with this whole chamber pop gig, but I fear that they’re not going to reach the heights they once did. Nice album, just nothing remarkable.
80%"
4.00,2022-10-22,"Arctic Monkeys are taking the David Bowie approach: Starting out their career making stuff most other artists at the time were making and eventually branching out into their own sound. Bowie started making folk music and folk rock like lots of other artists at the time, then went to rock operas, and eventually went on to make stuff like Low, Heroes, and Lodger. Arctic Monkeys started out making post punk revival and radio friendly alt rock, and now they’re making their own style of baroque pop and lounge music. I love this era."
3.00,2022-10-21,"I'm going to separate the good things and the bad things of the album, I don't do this kinds of reviews but I think it will work in this case:

The Good things: They aren't afraid to explore new territories. In comparison to their last record, The Car it's more eclectic, they lift off from where they left and they knew where to take the step towards a more chamber pop/soul sound. The the trademark sound of the album relays on 3 main aspects: It focuses more on string arrangements rather than piano, it sets appart more from psychedelic pop (Although they return to it at some points on the album). and its lyricism: They're cryptic like the ones on TBHC but here they are told or written in a more nostalgic and kinda sentimental way. The band told us before but they do it again ""Things aren't going to be like before (Mainly refering to AM)"", however I feel that here they're slowing down to look and reflect on their past rather than just move away from it.

The Bad: Like I mentioned, they took a step from their previous album... But it's more like a step backwards: Despite their effort to bring somthing more eclectic in this album, the songs hold on so much from the sound of this project instead of shinning by their own, there are lots of ideas here, but they feel kinda incomplete, trying to reach something but ending up on the same spot on most of the tracks, for example: in Sculptures Of Anything Goes we start with some dark sounding percussion and synths, but by the end of the track I feel that it took much longer to build up, same happens with Jet Skis On The Moat and the title track. Alex's vocals the vocals don't finish to convince me despite his vocal arrange. Every song on the album has a different idea, they explore different generes, from funk and darkwave to psychedelic pop and bossa nova, but most of em aren't really memorable or need to be developed more."
1.00,2022-10-21,"I fully respect that people can enjoy this and get something from it. If you enjoyed it, that's awesome and i wish i could enjoy it as much as you but tbch i really, really don't like this.
Like never want to listen to this or new Arctic Monkeys ever again don't like this.

My background with Arctic Monkeys is mainly the debut, Favorite Worst Nightmare and some tracks from AM. What i concurred at the time was that Arctic Monkeys were never going to tap back into the excitement of their debut, which is fine but then you have to replace that with something more rewarding, because you can't write catchy, intense bangers. You need some more excitement in a different type of way, be it experimenting or just mastering songwriting in a certain style. Arctic Monkeys does none, nada, zilch. And that is plainly evident in their newest record, The Car.

First of all, awful title and awful cover art. I don't really get excited when i think to myself that i'm going to listen to The Car, and the cover art just reinforces that it may be a bad idea. The name sounds like a stupid roadtrip family straight to DVD movie. From the makers of ""The Boat"" and ""The Building"" we give you ""The Car"".

First song on here isn't that bad, it's actually pretty decent but everything that comes after is just a snooze. You hear Mirrorball and you've basically heard the whole album, except for maybe Sculptures which ironically sounds like one of the songs Rick Rubin told Kanye to scrap because the first draft was apparently way too long and filled with duds. Which is a good descriptor for this album, a dud. Just a silent fart, no impact, no smell (It does stink tho) and no sound.

Mainly my largest gripe is Alex Turner's vocals which are grading to say the least. It sounds like he makes fun of the instrumental his bandmates and him crafted and just proceeds to joke sing over every track. It's just way too over the top without acknowledging its own goofyness. An example of over the top vocals from this year but done more tastefully imo is on Hellfire when Geordie Creep sings. It's so goofy and over the top, but that's kind of the point. It's supposed to be weird but it almost surpasses that weirdness by not taking itself that seriously. Alex Turner on the other hand sounds to me that he takes himself rather seriously. It sounds like he's genuinely trying to impress us. Well i guess he impresses the people who like his singing, but that isn't me unfortunately.

My other gripe with the album and also Alex Turner is the lyrics. If it is true that Body Paint is about him and a female having sex on the hood of a car and that his ""Body Paint"" is his cum i'm actually losing it. I genuinely hope so, because that shit is just way too fucking funny. If ""You can poke your head behind the mountain peak"" is about her looking at Alex over her tits while he's going down on her i'm actually fucking loosing it. I hope that i'm wrong but the song just makes me laugh out loud, i'm forever going to have that interpretation. For the rest of the album its just Alex Turner and women, and there wasn't really anything other than Body Paint that really caught my attention, unfortunately it didn't catch my attention in the best way, still funny though.

I guess i'll leave off on what i said earlier in the review, or what this was. That this may be the last Arctic Monkeys album that i'll consume. Of what i've heard of their other stuff it doesn't really encourage me to go listen to a full Arctic Monkeys album. Although if, and this is a big if. If Alex Turner somehow changes his vocal style, and the band does some cool interesting shit that is actually worth listening to, i'll maybe try it. But for now, Arctic Monkeys is so far from what i hoped them to be, because they're actually very talented. I guess i can't really hope for a band to do something ""I"" want, that's kinda selfish, but if they maybe did something differently i would have enjoyed their music. But for gods sake Arctic Monkeys should still do what they want to do and think is the right thing to do, i just think it's kind of ass.

(I would hope to post this as a comment instead but the comment system on RYM is pretty underwhelming so i posted a review instead)"
2.50,2022-10-21,"i feel like i can describe every song on this album in the same way, and like the whole thing can be summed up in a few words. and like, i really hoped i'd enjoy it more than i do because i maintain Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino is a super cool and unique record, if unfortunately underbaked, and that an album similar in its aesthetic prowess with more variety would be great! sadly though, Arctic Monkeys at this point seem to consistently get like... one idea and then make an entire album out of it, leaving structure and cohesion out the door. it's cool, it's well-dressed and stylish, and even has some pretty nice and clever writing! but it has like 2 bones, and they're not very strong either."

3.50,2022-10-21,"pretty cool, there were a couple boring songs on here that sounded more or less the same but i enjoyed the overall sound of the album, good return from arctic monkeys !"
3.00,2022-10-21,"There were fleeting moments on this album where I felt like everything came together, but that was rare. For the most part, the instrumentation somehow simultaneously felt overproduced and underproduced.

Most of the vocal performances had the same effect. They came across as very theatrical, yet unrememberable. The songwriting was pretty mediocre as well."
3.00,2022-10-21,"In 2018 they shocked everyone with their new sound by evolving into something unique but also an underwhelming direction. While I still came back to TBH&C occasionally for Science Fiction, Four Out of Five and the title track of that album haven't really clicked for me to say at least. After releasing mirrorball as their first single to promote this album I was slightly hopeful that Turner is really up to something exciting and that he might have improved the underwhelming parts of TBH&C. Unfortunately, though The Car replicates the same song structures as TBH&C promising build-up until it falls short on the climaxes of the songs. This is not a bad album but clearly it's forgettable one only 3 songs have captured my attention completely (The Car, Sculpture of anything goes and mirrorball) the rest of them on my initial listens were forgettable. I've to talk about Sculptures of Anything goes though great for me to say at least I really like the gloomy atmospheric sound of this song. It reminds me of Queens of the Stone Age's Like Clockwork album. What I really hated about this album is the fact that I hate the guitars in this record yes the guitar is minimal but my god the funky guitar sections of I ain't quite where I am and Jet skis on moat are so fucking BORING. I prefer for them to abandon guitars rather than putting shitty funky riffs in their future releases, to be honest. I don't hate or love Jamie Cook but he isn't Niles Rodgers and he shouldn't be put in a position to just write funk ballads because they literally add nothing to the material whatsoever. In conclusion, The Car is slightly better than TBH&C but it's still boring just like it's ancestor. 65/100

FAV TRACKS: Sculptures of Anything Goes, The Car, MirrorBall.

LEAST FAV TRACKS: I ain't quite think where I am, Jet skis on the moat, Hello you,"
3.50,2022-10-21,"Music for airport terminals, (Earth-bound) hotel lobbies, and peering out the 25th-floor window of office buildings. Very daring of them to bring back the musical style of Tranquility Base Hotel after that album's reception, but I think they correctly assessed that the main dragging factor there was the concepts, not the music.

I actually like what they've been going for recently more than any of their previous styles. I don't think they've quite got it down yet; this album lacks setpieces. There are very few memorable melodies to structure the soundscapes.

Some tracks do it well; like the squirmy funk bass in ""I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am,"" or the pensive, ever-building outro of ""Hello You."" Other tracks, however, simply never find their footing. A lot of it is down to lyricism, as the group seems determined to wind as many words into their verses as possible, to the detriment of both melody and subtlety.

I do have to commend them for continuing down the sonic path of Tranquility Base Hotel, however. In this case, iterating was a much more audacious choice than swerving yet again, and the album comes very near to greatness because of it. The soundscapes painted here call to mind vintage films, modern skyscrapers, and the allure of the great creation. It's a lament to listlessness, missed opportunity—and to the architect, who finds themself wandering the city alone."
3.00,2022-10-21,"The whole album just feels like one very long song, containing little to no variations in it. As if they had some leftover ideas that didn't make it to Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino and decided to release them four years later."
3.50,2022-10-21,"Love them or hate them, you have to agree that for such a mainstream act like Arctic Monkeys, their creative trajectory is one of the most interesting out there. They are way past their aggressive indie rock roots from their earliest records. Hell, I would even say that The Car is the furthest they've transitioned from their debut album. To me, this is their most lowkey and subtle album, even subtler than 2018's Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino. It's very admirable that after an album as big as AM (even nowadays the songs still do massive numbers on Spotify) the band doesn't even make an attempt to sell their soul out.

There is no ""Do I Wanna Know"" or ""I Bet That You Look Good on The Dancefloor"" in this album. This album is not for the impatient. It's not a show of aggression. It's a showcase of lushness. The songs on The Car embraces various shades of chamber pop. In a way, it is reminiscent of TBHC, but with less of a lounge-y sound to them. Singles like ""There’d Better Be a Mirrorball"" and ""Body Paint"" are elegantly arranged and glamorous, there are a lot of clean instrumental details in them that are very cool. This also applies on songs like ""Big Ideas"" and ""Hello You"", both of them have gorgeous violins I can't get enough of. Just like TBHC, Alex Turner's lazy and sometimes high demeanor fits so damn well with the instrumental palette on this album. Granted, his voice can get a little goofy when he reaches to his higher register, like on ""Body Paint"", but I don't think it derails too much of anything.

However, I ran into the same issues I had with TBHC. Some of the songs, while they are pretty, they fleet by without much of an impression, or they just blend into the album too much. This is the case for the title track, as well as the third and fourth track that I don't even want to bother to spell their names out.

Overall, this is pretty much on the same quality level as TBHC, and that's not a bad thing. That album is also solid, and if the band keeps going further into whatever genres they're aiming for, I'm on their backs.

Best tracks: There’d Better Be a Mirrorball, Body Paint, Big Ideas, Hello You"
3.50,2022-10-21,"So I've never been a huge 'Arctic Monkey's' fan, I can say I enjoy their debut and their self-titled the most but they've never really been a band I've admired strongly, the fact that 'Tranquillity Base Hotel + Casino"" was a bad album didn't help that.

I went into this record knowing what to expect, hearing that it's basically ''Tranquillity Base Hotel + Casino 2"". Firstly I thought ""Oh no, if it's anything like that record it can't be good"", but the first single defied expectations, it's really good for the band.

This record has better production, vocals, song-writing, instrumentals, literally everything, it's like their last record but miles better. Loving the orchestrations too.

The big problem is that the album is boring in places and manages to feel incredibly repetitive whilst being less than 40 minutes long..

""Hello You"", ""There’d Better Be A Mirrorball"", ""Perfect Sense"" and "" I Ain’t Quite Where I Think I Am"" are the highlights.

To conclude, this is a pretty good album but It could've been a bit better, needed more drive I'd say."
4.00,2022-10-21,I would describe it as a more digestable version of Tranquility Base. I do miss the cool concept but the songs are overall easier to get into and even somehow more chill. It's a shame that we won't get more early AM but this is an interesting direction soundwise and I absolutely adore the luscious string arrangements. If there's anything to complain about it would be the lack of any stand out song and perhaps that the album is a tad bit too short.
4.00,2022-10-21,"For who want to search for old indie rock, this is not the place. After TBHC they changed their sound, fortunately, and with this album they're continuing to evolve. This LP is better than TBHC. This is not paragonable to their older works. Few guitars, good orchestra and pretty piano. Some good acoustic songs, like title track and Mr. Schwartz. Very good production, James Ford do a great work, like TBHC.

For me is 4/5

Best songs: Big Ideas, Body Paint"
3.50,2022-10-21,"The four and a half year wait is finally over. Here we have the band's seventh installment, and boy do I have a lot to say on it.

Now, first of all, I've only listened to the album twice through in it's entire release. A lot of albums, I would argue most, take quite a few listens and a substantial amount of time to really get a grip on. There's many things I like about this album but I also have a few bones to pick with it as well.

For starters, I'll say the production is quite solid. The flow is good, the songs go well together and the album's general theme feels nice and lush. The concept of the album is nice, circulating songs around the idea of ""The Car"" as the title implies, and it feels like a carefully crafted project put together. Alex's vocals more or less gently take you through and through, the instrumentations right behind him.

Another big thing to point out, which I mentioned on my review of ""There'd Better be a Mirrorball"", is how happy I am with Alex and the boys' decision to not feel pressured to keep up with mainstream flow. It is blatantly obvious that that is past them at this point in their career, ""AM"" was released and after that the Arctic Monkeys decided not to give a fuck what they did next. Not saying that they released ""AM"" purely for mainstream, but that record more than anything fit the airwaves nicely, despite that not being it's, perhaps, immediate intention. ""The Car"" is a pretty obvious example of the band following what they really want to pursue, which is stripped-back, methodical music. And to that I tip my hat to them.

The actual songs: ""There'd Better be a Mirrorball"" is a grand opener, the piano and strings kinda doing their own thing before dramatically launching into the song itself sets up the record nicely. The track's flow is excellent, the strings are touching, and Alex's entire vocal and lyrical performance is great. I would claim it as the second best song on the album.

""I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am"" is nice counter to the opener, the funky riff is nice and fun, and Alex's lyrics, as always, appear very obscure and odd upon first listen. That is one thing that I love about Alex Turner, his lyrics can sometimes be so specific and strange that sometimes the listener can just decipher it however they want. I also love the second half strings here that come in for a bit, confusing the listener for a second, and then going right back to the riff.

""Sculptures of Anything Goes"" is fucking amazing, it is so unlike anything else that the band has done. It is sinister, slow, and grand. The layers of the song unfold beautifully. It sounds like something MGMT would attempt. The synth work here is top tier, Alex kills it on the mic and again, the instrumentation is just fucking crazy good. ""Guess I'm talking to you now, puncturing your bubble of relatability."" One of the best lines on the album, and the delivery is crazy. The best song on the album.

""Jet Skies on the Moat"" is alright, ""Body Paint"" is great, that keyboard (or whatever it is, I honestly can't tell) is quite nice and the mid section of the song is like the prelude to the grandeur finish. It's damn good, everything feels just right here. The song ""The Car"" is pretty solid, I like the storytelling and the piano is nice, and the acoustic guitar very faintly lifts the song up and fills a small void for the atmosphere.

One big complaint I have is that I will admit, I think the strings are a tad overdone on this album; I could do without it at times on songs like ""Hello You"" and ""Mr Schwartz"", but I get that the string arrangements and presence in the songs is what makes it quite distinguishable from the previous record ""Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino"". The electric guitar work is pulled back, just like the previous album, which is nothing I complain about since it comes in here when it needs to instead of stealing the spotlight like previous albums (besides maybe ""I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am"").

""Big Ideas"" contain some of my favorite lyrics on the record, to me it sounds like Alex losing concentration on his music due to other factors in his life distracting him, and his delivery of this idea is pulled over quite nicely, with lines such as ""I've conjured up wonderful things, the ballad of what could've been, over and out, it's been a thrill."" And yet again, the keyboard is great on this song, filling in the gaps where it should. ""Hello You"" is okay, but the strings give me this weird Disney theme song vibe and it kinda off puts me, which is funny considering it goes with a decently hard riff by the albums standards. It's one of my least favorites alongside ""Mr Schawrtz"", which is probably my least favorite song on the album.

""Perfect Sense"" is a nice closer, touching in the manner I knew it would come in, but I will admit I expected something I love as much as ""The Ultracheese"". But again, maybe I just need some time for it to grow on me.

All-in-all, a 3.5 album upon my first few listens. I do wish that there were more backing vocals on the record, I love them on ""I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am"", and I feel like they could've been nice on a few other tracks. My biggest take, however, is that I wish there was a little more experimentation. When I first heard ""Sculptures of Anything Goes"" I was excited because I anticipated the rest of the album to more or less sound as crazy as that. But, it was not.

But again, overall, not too bad. Underwhelming in a lot of areas, but I hope that this album grows on me a bit more. It's a nice record, and despite some gripes with it, I again tip my hat to Alex and the rest of the band. They have come a long way in their career. A long way indeed."
1.50,2022-10-21,"When I first listened to this album I thought it was alright, though I had never heard an arctic monkeys album before I found myself lead on by the strings on this album.

Then, I came back to it and thought ""this is kind of boring and I really never want to hear this again"" so I bumped the score down to 2.5 stars.

Then I listen to the first arctic monkeys album and found myself amazed on how such an exciting, youthful, energetic, personality filled band went downhill this bad. The Car after a measly 2 listens had failed to impress me on any level, and returning to the project I find myself lost in my thoughts on how such a great band created such a dull album. The only song that offers any interesting qualities would be Sculptures of Anything Goes and even that song has worn down after a few listens, It doesn't matter if you listen to this album or not because you'll probably forget it even existed after a couple weeks."
4.00,2022-10-21,"i disliked the singles but this is pretty good!!
especially big ideas
also the car
nice! i am excited to see them live in november!"
2.50,2022-10-21,"The orchestrations are good, the production is gorgeous and lush and the instrumentals keep taking you through twists and trying to surprise you little elements. It's an extremely cinematic album and every time a string arrangement appears it floats beautifully. The way they elevate the ending of There'd Better Be A Mirrorball is the reason I still think of that song from relatively often.

... And I'm still not that into it as I wish I was and as much as I know a lot of dedicated fans of this last era will certainly be.

The songs at the core of it aren't that interesting to me. The lyrics and Alex's vocals in his crooning really aren't doing that much for me either - I think he's more happy with his lighter head voice and falsetto than he should be if i'm honest.

I actually respect how artistically minded they are - they certainly aren't shaping their sound for commercial gains. It's clear they are as sharp and mature as musicians as they have ever been and there is a lot of creative juice behind these songs but the outcome does not stick with me as a listener. It's all tight and layered but it all sounds a lot more fun to create and to play than to listen, if that makes sense.

Just to end on a positive note, I think that they did quite well within their vision was to progressively build their songs towards a finish. I already talked about Mirrorball and there is often a release when the symphonic and rock instruments collide in those climaxes, as they do in Body Paint. Funny enough, Sculpture of Anything Goes left me frustrated for the opposite reason - the most interesting journey from the early start but I wanted it to hit an extra gear it never reaches.

I definitely still leave these first couple of listens with a positive reaction. I don't know, 6/10? Maybe it can grow towards a 7 with a few more listens but I don't think it's gonna do much more than that for me personally."
3.00,2022-10-21,"I think the production quality on this album is top-notch. It is a sonically beautiful album. It's pretty orchestral and Alex Turner's singing is perfectly suited for it But to be frank, it isn't particularly interesting. They made an album about cars. I know I know, it's more about the symbolism or whatnot, but I just find it strange. It's similar to their last album, they made a whole ass album about hotels, what? I'm being a bit tongue-in-cheek but I think you get my point.

It's not really a one-to-one, but I'd say this album is definitely in the same vain as their last, Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino, and not just because of the strange subject matter. So if you really enjoyed that record you'll like this one for sure.

It's interesting and creative, I think looking at it neutrally I respect the direction they are taking there sound, like they can't be an edgy romantic band forever, but to me personally I don't give a shit.

Whilst Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino had a couple standout tracks I like to listen to, none of the songs on this album stick out to me, and if I never listened to this album or it's songs again, I wouldn't mind at all. A forgettable experience to me.

It's not boring in an overly mundane fashion, so I wouldn't say it's the definition of mediocrity. But it's not really good either, just okay in my view. This really comes down to a matter of opinion for me, if someone thought this was an 8 or even a 9/10 I would find that perfectly reasonable, I'd be more surprised by a negative opinion. Despite my critical musings, I still think it's a decent effort and would give it a 6/10"
4.50,2022-10-20,"Alex Turner has had a particularly interesting evolution as a writer. Going from being the darling of the North, writing 'proper lads tunes' about smashing people with pool cues and comparing cock sizes to bingo utensils (and so on and so forth) to being invited into the desert by Josh Homme and seemingly instantaneously deciding to become an 18th century Romantic poet, before dabbling into a bit of commercialised rock. However, with both this album and Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino, we've seen a side of Turner that stands above the rest of his works. Whilst he's always truly been a great lyricist - weaving in scathing ironic jabs and winding streams of metaphors into his tracks, the last two records have appeared to show him at his most self-aware.

Now, what exactly is he self-aware of? In case you weren't already aware (ie. you have been living in a cave for the past decade), the Arctic Monkeys have grown recently to become one of the biggest rock bands of the 21st century. Across that time, they've garnered a legion of fans, a legion of critics, and a legion of constantly changing styles with an ever-growing itch to keep switching between them. The last album, TBHC, wrestled the band's trajectory away from the commercialised indie rock sounds of AM and Suck It and See, in order to blend Bowie-esque crooning with...lounge music. Despite the band's passion and great creativity on the album, it didn't really strike the critical acclaim the band probably wanted, and although it's recently started to be retroactively seen as 'really bloody good, actually', there's still your obvious crowd of people who wish that the band would just make 'A Certain Romance 2 - Electric Boogaloo'.

No, by the time The Car freewheeled onto the scene, the band were well past the days of reminiscing about Sheffield nights out. Instead, on this album they seem to take TBHC's dip into experimentation and plunge right off the biggest diving board with it. From the off, the first track 'Mirrorball' starts out with this heavenly set of orchestral strings, as well as a falsetto from Alex that leaves you weak at the knees. 'Sculptures of Anything Goes' has possibly the most threatening ambience the band have ever gone for, with atmospheric and noisy bass synths dominating the soundscape as Alex's uncertain lines thread through the void. 'Body Paint' was immediately cemented as an all time classic for the band from the day it was released as a single, deceiving listeners with a gentle opening part before mutating into glam-rock infused brilliance. There's also the curious case of the title track, which feels like it blends Spanish-infused style with passionate indie formulas. Honestly, I could go on - from Pink Floyd sounding solos to dainty piano lines, every inch of this album feels like it's trialling something new.

Now, I'm not going to even sit here for a minute and try and say all of this experimentation works. As good as the idea of 'throw stuff at the wall and see what works' might be for instigating creativity, the underwhelming 'Jet Skis on the Moat' goes to demonstrate what an idea on here can feel like if it's not developed properly. Furthermore, despite 'Mr Schwartz' at times hinting it wants to break past the cover of being a simple, dainty ballad regarding a greedy executive, it never truly puts forward much to write home about from either a lyrical or musical standpoint.

Yet, when the vast majority of what's on offer works so well, I absolutely have to give this record the credit it deserves. As Alex almost laments his career and how it has limited him on 'Big Ideas', wishing he could produce the 'Ballad of What Could Have Been', you feel this true personal feeling creep right out into centre view, something you cannot simply wave away. Whereas many have been able to wave off previous Monkeys records as 'dull', 'fuelled by hype', 'underwhelming' or 'over commercialised' - criticisms which, I agree, have their place in this band's catalogue - I feel ignoring the pure feelings of ambition and intelligence the lyrics of this record present will be a far harder task. In an album that relishes in trying out new things, the Arctic Monkeys have taken the idea of their 'generic' sound and torched it. I truly hope their future endeavours may be as varied and eclectic as this."
3.50,2022-10-19,"I have in thought that this band is very overhated around here. I don't think they're that bad.

But at the point, I was first listening to the car waiting a part 2 of TBHC, and yes at some part it has the finesse and elegant sort of sounds as it predecessor, but at the end it doesn't feel the same album. In general thoughts, TBHC sounds more silent than this disc, while the current one has more sound, you have from glam rock, to baroque, soul, and even chamber pop, which I generally like.

But at the end, it's inconsistently meaningless. This is more about the sounds, not it's messages or what it wants to portrait, and I say this is the weakest point of the album, because Alex has the potential in his voice to protrait something better with it, this feels like if he was trying to be memetic but he fails in the try.

It has no clear path of what it wants to transmit at the end, but only to be romantic-ambient sounds."
4.00,2022-10-19,"I am an Arctic Monkeys defender. I recognize that the image a lot of people on this site have of them is…not favorable, to say the least, but AM and TBH&C are two of my favorite albums of the 2010’s. I’ve adored the latter since the day it released and the former has soundtracked some of the best nights of my life. I truly believe they’re one of the most artistically uncompromising mainstream bands of this century, and the leap from AM to TBH&C at the height of their commercial success is one of the most bold moves from a household-name band since that-band-that-shall-not-be-named. I spent quite a while waiting for The Car, and after three stellar singles, the album is finally here and it’s fantastic.

It’s impossible to talk about The Car without talking about Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, which laid the groundwork for this album. The Car is somewhat of a Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino 2, but augmented with an immense string section and a collection of songs that feels more confident and less awkward than some of the tracks on its predecessor. There’s not a fully realized concept here like the dystopian retro-futurism found on TBH&C, but The Car is even more cohesive, carrying a greater cinematic feeling and exploring even darker undertones than TBH&C.

There’s an argument to be made that any of the three singles, “There’d Better Be a Mirrorball”, “Body Paint”, and “I Ain’t Quite Where I Think I Am”, could be career highlights for the band, with Turner’s signature crooning voice and charmingly idiosyncratic lyrics pairing to make songs that compete with the best of TBH&C. And beyond the singles, the album has a lot more to offer. All over The Car are traces of Serge Gainsbourg, David Bowie, Lee Hazlewood, Gram Parsons, and Scott Walker. Even more than it’s predecessor, it feels like an album ripped straight out of the ‘70’s, with the groovy funk guitar of “I Ain’t Quite Where I Think I Am” and “Jet Skis on the Moat” and the cosmic country tendencies of the title track proving to be sounds the band can pull off with ease. Who would’ve guessed the garage rockers from Sheffield would ever be making songs like this? It’s an incredible artistic progression. We’re certainly a long way from AM’s bluesy riffs and even farther from the incendiary shredding of the band’s debut. The closest this album comes to anything resembling AM may be “Hello You”, a mildly uptempo song that in some ways reminds me of “Snap Out of It” and “Knee Socks”. And while there are flashes of guitar on “The Car”, “Body Paint”, “Jet Skis on the Moat”, and “I Ain’t Quite Where I Think I Am”, these moments are brief. I do think an area where The Car improves on TBH&C is the guitars. They’re a bit more present here and there’s a variety of different tones used, adding a lot of different colors to the instrumentation.

“The Car” is a particular highlight for me. The entire track calls back to the debut of The Last Shadow Puppets, an Ennico Morricone-esque song with a driving rhythm that would be perfect alongside the other spaghetti western songs of that album. It ends with a frustratingly short but wailing guitar solo.

“Sculptures of Anything Goes” is an undeniable highlight, with a distorted drumbeat and ominous synth creating an atmosphere that wouldn’t be unusual on a sci-fi film soundtrack. It’s not far off from something Massive Attack would make and is easily the most unique track in the band’s discography. The lyrical themes certainly remind me of TBH&C — “Performing in Spanish on Italian TV sometime in the future” and especially “The simulation cartridge for City Life ’09 a pretty tricky to come by” read like lines right out of “Star Treatment” and “She Looks Like Fun”. The song builds to a restrained but effective climax with droning, foreboding guitars, before leading into the funky “Jet Skis on the Moat”.

“Perfect Sense” is very much like “The Ultracheese”, with the intro being near-identical (though the song itself, in my opinion, is not quite as strong). Like the other tracks on the album, it’s supplemented by a tidal wave of strings, but they work probably most effectively on this track, a short-but-sweet ballad that feels like an excellent final chapter to the album. Despite its short length, this song elicits the most emotion from me, making me reminisce on the past and long for times gone by. The end of The Car comes quickly, at just over 37 minutes, but every moment of this album has been toiled over and fiercely considered. There’s not a wasted second to be found.

The Car’s lyrics are fascinating, as to be expected from lyrical mastermind Alex Turner (easily one of the best of his generation, in my opinion). Esoteric lines like “Lego Napoleon movie written in noble gas-filled tubes underlined in sparks” sit alongside personal revelations like “If you’re thinking of me, then I’m probably thinking of you”. The writing on this album is incredibly rich, and Turner weaves through personal epiphanies and eccentric imagery with ease. I do think TBH&C is lyrically a superior album, but the defined concept of that album lends itself much more to better lyrics. And The Car is by no means a regression - Turner is still in peak form here, both vocally and lyrically, effortlessly employing his signature croon, falsetto, and even on occasion an almost raspy Bowie-infused voice based on what a given song requires.

Much like its predecessor, The Car is far more than the sum of its parts. I struggle to imagine listening to any of these tracks on their own, aside from the singles, as they all work far better in the context of the album, which plays out like a movie. If TBH&C was Technicolor, The Car is most definitely noir. After listening to it a few times, I don’t think this album is quite as dynamic or varied as TBH&C, but I do think it’s more cohesive and confident sonically. It feels like a fully realized vision of the TBH&C sound, substituting some of the cheekiness for introspection. Detractors of that album probably won’t be converted by this one - it never really exceeds a brisk tempo, and instrumental breaks are merely considered, fleeting moments. But it’s beautifully composed and arranged, with the string section adding a lot of grandeur and emotion that was absent on TBH&C.

After a few listens, I don’t quite adore The Car the same way I do TBH&C, but it’s still a monumental album, and it would be naive to think a newly-released album could immediately overtake one that I hold so close and have had years to let sink in. There’s no doubt I’ll spend the remainder of the year mulling over the contents of this album, uncovering every layer, interpreting every lyric, and piecing together what will undoubtedly be another Arctic Monkeys masterpiece and may, in time, end up as their best album. We can only hope we don’t have to wait four years for the next."
5.00,2022-09-27,Easily their best album so far but I guarantee the kids will absolutely hate it
2.50,2022-09-21,"""I don't want to hear old sad b#rstard music, Barry."" He stares at his feet. ""I just want something I can ignore."" - as Rob from high fidelity says quoting a Monday morning album listen. The Car regurgitates some of the same ideas from there previous lounge album TBH&C and transforms them into uninspired pop songs (Body paint), bland and monotonous Motown numbers (I ain’t quite where I think I am) and aesthetically airy and loose moments that leaves like the titled track and most of the tracks here like there tires are stuck in the mud and unable to get on to solid ground unfortunately. The Car is well too indulgent that’s pretty at times (there better be a mirrorball, perfect sense) but can only accomplish and excel for anything other than for background and casual listens."
